# VolleyballSwingSimulator
## Antoine Assaf 4/15/2025

This project simulates athletes' volleyball arm swings and remodels them to show what adjustments can be made. In volleyball, the mechanics of a powerful arm swing are central to effective offensive play, yet the physics of such motion is often intuitive and underexplored quantitatively. This project presents a computational biomechanics framework for simulating and analyzing volleyball arm swings using a 3D double pendulum model, guided by real-world pose data through MediaPose AI pose tracking.

This project is mathematically and computationally rigorous, which is why I put the code in a Jupyter notebook called `FinalProjectReportAndCode.jpynd` so it is easy to follow along. The important visuals that the notebook generates do not fit all in the notebook (GitHub has a max size limit), so see the `result_gifs` folder to see the generated model results.

There is also a Google Sheets presentation link [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ngkEj570Q9AR_ioHgSVsZ9D1tItXbXuEXXEPR8DTSe4/edit?usp=sharing).
